# InfoSEC Course Notes: Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation and Evasion - Week 1
This repository contains my notes for Week 1 of the InfoSEC course on Coursera. The course covers python topics related to cybersecurity, including execution, persistence, privilege escalation, and evasion.
### Contents

The `Execution, persistence, privilege escalation and evasion/Week 2` directory contains the following files:

- `README.md`: this file, providing an overview of the contents of the directory
- `MaliciousLinks.py`: a Python script creates a simple HTTP server that redirects users to Google <i>(Or other website)</i> after logging their username and password from the query string.
- `sched.py`: a Python script creates a scheduled task to run a security scan at a random interval.
- `notes.md`: my personal notes on the topics covered in Week 2
